#Overview#

This document outlines analytic strategy for APC analysis of data for NCD class.

#Summary#

I have six countries with sevaral different NCD systems. I will be using APC analysis (intrinsic estimator) on mortality rates. 

To analyze, I will need tables that disaggregates age-specific causes of death into a number of different categories, including:
   (1) heart disease and diabetes (key), 
   (2) communicable/acute, noncommunicable/chronic, accidents/external
   (3) total mortality

I can prepare these as three separate tables; I will start with total mortality as this is easiest.
