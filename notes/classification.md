#Overview#

For NCD class, I need to highlight NCD burden of a country. I have chosen 6 countries in Central America/Carribean to focus on using an APC set of models. Many apparently use different mortaltity lists across ICD9 and ICD10. I need to understand how these lists work and translate to one another.

#Summary#

1) Documentation from the raw data in the [mortality database](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality_rawdata/en/) lists a number of tabulations for ICD7 through ICD10, including Lists "A" and "B" from the "condensed" list. These lists are contained in "Part 2" of the document (in a .doc table).

These include full sets of underlying causes for comparability.
