Based on work with Belize, I looked up Cambodia in the International Household Survey Network and the Global Health Data Exchange. 

1. [IHSN](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog) tracked 34 studies for Cambodia. The follwoing may have some use:  
  - In 1998, the ministry of health conducted a health interview survey ([link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/4529/study-description)). While it focused on maternal health, it also has data on the availability of health services and microdata is available.  
  - An ongoing SES survey has some health info, and it covers many years, but it doesn't look like microdata is available. ([link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/3278/related_materials)).  
  - 2010 Demographic and health survey with microdata (much of the focus is on sexuality, but it has a fair amount of detailed informaiton on access. ([link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/1514)).  
  - 2005 Demographic and health survey with microdata (didn't look, but I assume as before that this is generally limited to maternal, child, and sexual health). ([Link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/190))  
  - 2000 Demographic and health survey with microdata-appears generally as before; has some "anthropometry" whatever that is. ([Link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/31/study-description))  
  - 2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey - microdata NOT available, but reports are available ([Link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/1515/study-description))  
  - 2008 Anthropometric Survey - microdata NOT available, but study looks at nutrition and feeding patterns([Link](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/1484/study-description))  
  - 1998 General Population Census [Micro Data](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/29/get_microdata)  
  - 2008 General Poopulaiton Census [Micro Data](http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/29/get_microdata)

2. [Global Health Data Exchange](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/) tracks a number of datasets. The following may have some use:  
  - Phnom Penh Behavior surveillance (2000) ([Link](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/cambodia-phnom-penh-behavioral-surveillance-survey-2000)
  - 2004 Elderly Survey with available microdata (includes verbal autopsy information) ([Link](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/cambodia-elderly-survey-2004))  
  - Youth tobacco surveys include microdata ([2003](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/cambodia-global-youth-tobacco-survey-2003), [2010](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/cambodia-global-youth-tobacco-survey-2010)).  
  - A number of link-through annual health statistics are available thorugh Cambodia's ministry of health [reporting website](http://www.hiscambodia.org/public/health_statistic_en.php?m=6). (These appear to include diabetes prevalence).
  - Lancet article appears to identify possible surveys: King H, Keuky L, Seng S, Khun T, Roglic G, Pinget M. Diabetes and associated disorders in Cambodia: two epidemiological surveys. Lancet. 2005; 366(9497): 1633-9. ([Link](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/diabetes-and-associated-disorders-cambodia-two-epidemiological-surveys))
