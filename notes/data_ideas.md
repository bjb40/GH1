#Overview#

Need to pick a country to discuss in terms of NCD. Would like to make a publishable work out of this.

#Summary#

General Ideas
=============

1. Based on class discussion Africa is not a great idea.
2. Consider Latin America and engaging Carlos in the analysis for a joint project.
3. Mexico in connection with 

Datasets
========

1. Looked at ICPSR (international tag).
    - [SAGE](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/28502?classification=IDRC.V.&amp;paging.startRow=51): WHO study on global aging. In depth longitudinal made to integrate with other longitudinal studies like HRS. This uses China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa.
    - [Mexican Health and Aging Study](http://www.mhasweb.org/) Longitudinal study of Mexico - held at Penn - great data.
    - WHO Global burden of disease seems to have a lot of good data; although I could not find a nice and easy way to pull what I would be interested in.

2. Discussed with Professor 9/10. He concurs that South America is a good idea, and suggests a number of countries (though I need to double check to ensure that these are middle or low income countries; id'd from World Bank [Country Groups](http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~menuPK:64133156~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html)):  
    - Mexico (Upper-Middle-Income)
    - Brazil (Upper-Middle-Income)
    - Uruguay (Upper-Middle-Income)
    - Costa Rica (Upper-Middle-Income)

Some other thoughts:
    - Peru (Upper-Middle Income, but bold, so recently changed??)
    - Belize (bold Lower-Middle Income)
    - Bolivia
    - Ecuador
    - El Salvador
    - Guatemala
    - Honduras (data issues, I think)
    - Nicaragua
    - Paraguay

In addition, he suggested that there may be some Carribean nations that would be useful to review. Note that many of these middle-income countries listed above are in Central America, near the Carribean (along with Puerto Rico). A nice map is available [here](http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/central_america_map2.htm#).

#Final Thoughts#
I'll take alook at Central America and the Carribean generally; then pick a country or two that look interesting in terms of CVD/Diabetes and/or trends.
